## Root `/` and Home `~` Directories

### Root Directory (`/`)
- Root filesystem
- Top-level directory in Linux filesystem hierarchy
- Contains all system files, directories, and mounted filesystems

```bash
# Navigate to root directory
cd /

# List contents of root directory
ls /
# Output: bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
```

### Home Directory (`~`)
- Home directory (tilde expansion)
- User's personal directory for files and configurations
- Default location for user files, configurations, and personal data

```bash
# Navigate to home directory
cd ~
# or simply
cd

# Show current home directory path
echo $HOME
# Output: /home/username

```

## SSH (Secure Shell)

### Asymmetric Encryption - Public and Private Keys

-   Secure Shell with Public Key Infrastructure
-  Authentication method using cryptographic key pairs
-   Secure, passwordless authentication for remote server access

```bash
# Generate SSH key pair
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
# -t: key type (rsa, ed25519, ecdsa)
# -b: key length in bits
# -C: comment (usually email)

# Generate Ed25519 key (more secure, recommended)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# List SSH keys
ls -la ~/.ssh/
# Output shows: id_rsa (private), id_rsa.pub (public), known_hosts, authorized_keys

# Copy public key to remote server
ssh-copy-id user@remote_host

# Manually add public key to remote server
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@remote_host "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

### SSH and SCP Commands

#### SSH (Secure Shell)
-  Secure Shell
-  Encrypted network protocol for secure remote login and command execution
-  Remote server administration, secure file transfer, tunneling

```bash
# Basic SSH connection
ssh username@hostname

```

#### SCP (Secure Copy)
-  Secure Copy Protocol
-  Secure file transfer over SSH
-  Copying files between local and remote systems securely

```bash

scp file.txt username@hostname:/path/to/destination/

```

### Spark Clusters - Why Passwordless Access Matters

  - Job distribution across nodes
  - Monitoring and logging access
